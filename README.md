# Music Recommendation System

This project is a **Music Recommendation System** developed by Team Nan Mudhalvan as part of our academic learning. The system analyzes user preferences and suggests personalized music using collaborative filtering techniques. It demonstrates how basic recommendation logic works using Python and structured data.


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to recommend music tracks to users based on their previous ratings and preferences. By analyzing patterns in user behavior, the system identifies similarities and recommends new content the user is likely to enjoy. This is similar in concept to platforms like Spotify or YouTube Music.


## Features

- Suggests music based on user preferences
- Uses collaborative filtering (user-user or item-item)
- Clean and modular Python code
- Easy-to-understand CSV-based dataset
- Beginner-friendly project structure

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn *(optional)*  
- Streamlit *(optional for UI)*


## Project Files

- `app.py` – Main application logic
- `recommendation.py` – Recommendation algorithm
- `ratings.csv` – User ratings dataset
- `movies.csv` – Music/movies metadata


## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure all files are in one folder.
2. Open a terminal and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy

3. Run the main Python file:

python app.py


4. (Optional) If you're using Streamlit for UI:

streamlit run app.py
